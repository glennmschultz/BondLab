this Agreement and subject to the Exclusions, Bond Lab Technologies, Inc. will 
defend Bond Lab, LLC at Bond Lab Technologies, Inc expense and indemnify 
Bond Lab, LLC against any judgments finally awarded by a court or pay any 
settlements approved by Bond Lab, with respect to any claims or demands by a

demand (except that the Indemnifying Party may not agree to any settlement that
