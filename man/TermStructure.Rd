}
\arguments{
\item{rates.data}{A character string representing the data for which 
the user would like to call the swap curve}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the fitting method

\description{
This is a wrapper function around the R package termstrc.  
The function passes swap rate data
cash flows the to termstrc and creates the TermStructure object 
used by Bondlab.
The function call rates data processes the yield curve and derives cashflow
for the daily close swap curve. A Rates object must be called in the local
environment for this function to work.
