\title{A function to compute the time value of money
                 
A standard generic function used to calculate time value of money}
\usage{
TimeValue(
  interest.rate = numeric(),
  number.periods = numeric(),
  frequency = numeric(),
  type = "character"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interest.rate}{The interest rate used to determine the discount 
factor in decimal
form (i.e. 4.0\% is input as 0.04)}

\item{number.periods}{The number of discount periods.  For example, 
in the case of a mortgage whose cash flow occurs monthly over 
30 years the number of periods is 360.}

\item{frequency}{The frequency of interest payments.  For example the 
frequency of a mortgage whose payments occur monthly is 12}

\item{type}{The type of calculation PV = present value, 
PVA = present value of annuity, PVAD present value of annuity due,
FV = future value, FVA = future value of annuity.}
}
